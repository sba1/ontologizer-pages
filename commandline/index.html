<p>The command-line version of Ontologizer can be used for batch processing or pipelines. Most general users will prefer the Java WebStart version, though.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>If you want to use the command-line version, you need just need to download the <a href="../cmdline/Ontologizer.jar">Ontologizer.jar</a> file.</p>

<h2 id="installation-under-debian">Installation under Debian</h2>

<p>Users that run Debian or a Debian-based distribution are recommended to install the command-line version of Ontologizer
from Ontologizer&rsquo;s Debian repository. To do so, enter:</p>

<pre><code> $ su
 $ echo deb [arch=all] https://sba1.github.io/ontologizer-deb/ unstable main &gt;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ontologizer.list
 $ apt-get update
 $ apt-get install ontologizer-cli
 $ exit
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the Debian packages offered in this repository are currently not signed. You may need to install the Debian package <code>apt-transport-https</code>
prior these steps in order to allow downloading packages via the <code>https</code> protocol.</p>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p>Ontologizer is a Java-Application and if you downloaded the <a href="../cmdline/Ontologizer.jar">Ontologizer.jar</a> jar file, you need to start it via the <code>java</code> command.
But if you installed it via the Debian repository, you can invoke it more conveniently via the <code>ontologizer</code> wrapper script.</p>

<p>All possible command arguments along with a short description can be viewed via the <code>--help</code> argument. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>$ java -jar Ontologizer.jar --help
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ ontologizer --help
</code></pre>

<p>will produce following output:</p>

<p>In order to do something useful, Ontologizer must be started with several arguments (as indicated with &ldquo;Required&rdquo; within the output above).</p>

<h2 id="required-arguments">Required Arguments</h2>

<p>First, you are required to specify the <code>-g</code> (or <code>--go</code>) option. This defines the path to a file which contains the GO terminology and structure. Ontologizer is able to parse files in the OBO format. Such are available directly at the GO Website from <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology">http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology</a>.</p>

<p>Second, you are required to specify the <code>-a</code> option which defines the mapping of gene names to GO terms. The GO Website provides association files for a variety of organisms, as well. See <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/download-annotations">http://geneontology.org/page/download-annotations</a>.</p>

<p>Third, you must specify a population file with the <code>-p</code> option. This file contains all gene names (one per line) of the population set, e.g. the names of the genes of your microarray.</p>

<p>Last, you need to specify the path to your study set(s) with the <code>-s</code> option. This can either be a single file for a single study set or a directory, in which case all files (ending with <code>*.txt</code>) are considered as separate study sets. As for the population file, one line represents only a single gene name.</p>

<p>When started with these four parameters only, the output of Ontologizer&rsquo;s calculation is written to a basic ascii table file into the same directory where the study files are located. The table&rsquo;s filename is derived from the name of the study set in question but prepended with &ldquo;table-&rdquo; string.</p>

<h2 id="optional-arguments">Optional Arguments</h2>

<p>Using the <code>-d</code> option, you can instruct Ontologizer to create a graphical output of the results. For every study set, a file (name is prepended with &ldquo;view-&rdquo;) is written which can be read by the graphviz <code>dot</code> tool to produce a viewable graphics file. In this file, terms are depicted by nodes and their hierarchical relations are depicted by edges. Because the GO DAG contains a huge amount of terms, the graph is constructed only for significant terms and their predecessors (up to the source) and those significant terms are highligthed. Which terms are considered as significant is influenced by their p-values and the significance threshold. This threshold is specified as a parameter to the -d argument. It must be a valid floating point value ranging from 0 to 0.5. For example use <code>-d 0.05</code> to define those terms as significant whose p-value falls below 0.05.</p>

<p>In addition, you can specify a GO Term ID, after the floating-point value (separated by &ldquo;,&rdquo;). In this case only the subgraph starting at this term is written. For example use <code>-d 0.05,8152</code> to get only a graph with the term id <code>GO:0008152 (metabolism)</code> and its successors within the subgraph emanating from <code>GO:0008152</code> such that all significantly overrepresented terms are included in the graph.</p>

<p>Some sample datasets and population sets can be downloaded from this page.
To perform parent-child analysis using Westphal-Young MTC on the Yeast data set from the tutorial page and display the results using dot, enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -jar Ontologizer.jar -a gene_association.sgd -g gene_ontology.obo -s study/4hourSMinduced.txt -p population.txt -c Parent-Child-Union -m Westfall-Young-Single-Step -d 0.05 -r 1000
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding files must be in the current directory (or their full path must be indicated). To create a PNG image with the result, enter</p>

<pre><code>dot -Tpng view-4hourSMinduced-Parent-Child-Westfall-Young-Single-Step.dot -oExample.png
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding graphic should look something like this:
<img src="../images/Example.png" alt="Dot Example" /></p>

<h2 id="obtaining-graphviz">Obtaining Graphviz</h2>

<p>Graphviz is a Open Source project which provides tools for layouting and depicting graphs. Hereby, graph references to mathematical entities which consists of nodes and edges.</p>

<p>A installed Graphviz system is a requirement for Ontologizer&rsquo;s facility to visualize the results of an enrichment analysis. More precisely, the tool named dot is invoked which performs the layouting step of the graph.</p>

<p>Windows users can obtain the installation package of Graphviz following the Download link of www.graphviz.org. On this site, you also can find the latest source packages which can be used, for instance by Linux, users to compile the package. Linux Distributions such as Debian provide binary packages for Graphviz as well. This allows a straithforward installation of Graphviz.</p>

<p>Note that in general, the standard installtion (of the Windows and Linux installation) is perfectly suited for Ontologizer. If however, for any reason, the dot exectutable is not in the command path, you have to tell Ontologizer explicitly where this command can be found by entering the full path within the Preferences window, which can be obtained via the Window &gt; Preferences&hellip;. menu entry.</p>
